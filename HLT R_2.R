#Imagine the following scenario:
#You are a data analyst at an organisation. 
#You have been given a data set and asked to create a meaningful data visualisation using this data. 
#Using the ggplot in-built data sets in RStudio and the qplot
#function, get your creative juices flowing and create a meaningful 
#and impactful data visualization using your preferred data set.

#(1)Write an R program to create three vectors a, b, c with 5 integers. 
#Combine the three vectors to become a 3Ã—5 matrix where each column represents a vector. 
#Print the content of the matrix. Plot a graph and label correctly.

ggplot(m, aes(x, y, z)) + geom_line()

#(2)Write a R program to create a Data frames which contain details of 5 employees and display the details. 
#(Name, Age, Role and Length of service).

####################Home Learning Task R_2 Optional Challenge

#(1)Write a R program to get the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

Fibonacci <- numeric(10)
Fibonacci[1] <- Fibonacci[2] <- 1
for (i in 3:10) Fibonacci[i] <- Fibonacci[i - 2] + Fibonacci[i - 1]
print("First 10 Fibonacci numbers:")
print(Fibonacci)

#(2)Write a R program to print the numbers from 1 to 100 
# and print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, print "Buzz" for 
#multiples of 5, and print "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.

for (n in 1:100) {
  if (n %% 3 == 0 & n %% 5 == 0) {print("FizzBuzz")}
  else if (n %% 3 == 0) {print("Fizz")}
  else if (n %% 5 == 0) {print("Buzz")}
  else print(n)
